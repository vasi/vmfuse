- Rewrite in Python/vboxapi
	- Can wait for VM to close
- Have VMs poweroff themselves when sshfs disconnects
	- Use sshd_config ForceCommand wrapper
	- Should work even if host shuts down
- Use kqueue/inotify/polling/fam to wait for unmount, just to be sure
	- Check if same FS with st_dev
	- How to check for disconnect/hang in sshfs?
- Search for old VMs and auto-cleanup


* Bugs
	- Don't print anything on success

* Robustness
	- Test that host shutdown unmounts safely
	- Test failure conditions
		- No target mountpoint
		- VM creation fails
		- Guest boot fails
		- Guest mount fails
		- SSH/sshfs fails
	- Ensure VM is properly shutdown, even if something goes wrong
		- Poll for unmount?
	- Don't print extraneous output

* Useful options
	- Target volume arguments
		- Specify combined disk/index, not separate arguments
		- Allow full disk
		- Allow disk images
	- VM arguments
		- VM base
		- VM snapshot
	- Help option should provide usage help
	- Use a config file for some arguments
	- Automatically determine some parameters
		- Guest device name
		- VM base, given desired FS format?
	- Allow multiple host devices, guest devices, mountpoints
		- Useful for LVM
			- Only one VM at a time can own PV
			- VG may need multiple PVs
	- Auto-mounting?

* Permissions
	- We want to run VBox as user, but some things need extra permissions
		- Invoke sudo?
		- Optionally drop permissions if run using sudo?
	- Raw disk creation needs full disk access
		- Cache previous results?
	- Access to disk itself needs permissions
		- Chown and revert on cleanup?
	- Solve issue with root-owned files on guest

* Portability
	- Non-Linux guests
		- FreeBSD (UFS)
		- Dragonfly BSD (HAMMER)
		- Mac OS X (HFS+)
		- Solaris (ZFS pool version > 28)
	- Non-Mac hosts
		- Linux
		- FreeBSD

* Less useful options
	- Potential
		- VM group for clones
		- Custom guest mount command
		- Extra SSH/sshfs options, like key file
		- VBox home dir
	- These should probably be part of VM setup, not options
		- Guest mountpoint
		- Guest user
		- Guest SSH port
		- Port forwarding rule name
	- Unlikely to be useful at all
		- VM host, should always be localhost
		- VMDK basename
		- Sleep interval/maximum
