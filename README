TODO
* Add real README, LICENSE
	- Dependencies
	- Purpose
	- Usage
	- Compare to libguestfs
	- Caveats
* Don't hard-code things
	- host mountpoint
	- disk/partition/image to add to VM
	- device to mount in guest
	- base VM name
	- VM group
	- SSH key
* Take command-line arguments
	- Use config file too
	- Pass things through to sshfs
* Document VM creation: sudo, ssh, auth keys, persistent MAC, mountpoint, snapshot
* Use smaller VM (TinyCore)
	- Fix udev problem?
* Work with non-raw media: Don't create raw VMDK if given an image
	- Don't delete existing image!
* Work on Linux hosts
* Minimize use of sudo: Can probably create VMDK without it on OS X
* Auto-mount something useful if nothing specified
* Allow multiple disks and/or mounts
* Stop printing lots of info

TEST
* Do we unmount cleanly on host reboot?
* Can multiple separate mounts happen at the same time?

BUGS
* sshfs has trouble with permission mapping, new files are owned by root
* Boot is slow, can it be made faster?
