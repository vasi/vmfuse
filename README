TODO
* Add real README, LICENSE
	- Dependencies
	- Purpose
	- Usage
	- Compare to libguestfs
	- Caveats
* Don't hard-code things
	- host mountpoint
	- disk/partition/image to add to VM
	- device to mount in guest
	- base VM name
	- VM group
	- SSH key
* Take command-line arguments
	- Use config file too?
	- Pass options through to sshfs?
* Document VM creation
	- Base: TinyCore, other
		- TinyCore has udev problem?
	- sudo, ssh, auth keys, persistent MAC, mountpoint, snapshot
* Work with non-raw media: Don't create raw VMDK if given an image
	- Don't delete original image!
* Work on Linux hosts
* Permissions
	- Device may need to be user-owned
		- Revert ownership on exit?
	- Need access to whole disk to generate raw disk
		- Raw disk needs to be chowned to user
		- Cache it?
	- sudo: Automatically invoke? Drop permissions?
* Auto-mount something useful if nothing specified
* Work multiple disks and/or mounts?
* Don't print extraneous info
* Cleanup on failures! Delete VM, poweroff if necessary...
	* Poll mountpoint?
* Allow specifying partition device, not host + partition number

TEST
* Do we unmount cleanly on host reboot?
* Can multiple separate mounts happen at the same time? Should work...

BUGS
* sshfs has trouble with permission mapping, new files are owned by root
* Boot is slow, can it be made faster?
